pi@screenlypi3:~ $ strace -h
usage: strace [-CdffhiqrtttTvVwxxy] [-I n] [-e expr]...
              [-a column] [-o file] [-s strsize] [-P path]...
              -p pid... / [-D] [-E var=val]... [-u username] PROG [ARGS]
   or: strace -c[dfw] [-I n] [-e expr]... [-O overhead] [-S sortby]
              -p pid... / [-D] [-E var=val]... [-u username] PROG [ARGS]

Output format:
  -a column      alignment COLUMN for printing syscall results (default 40)
  -i             print instruction pointer at time of syscall
  -o file        send trace output to FILE instead of stderr
  -q             suppress messages about attaching, detaching, etc.
  -r             print relative timestamp
  -s strsize     limit length of print strings to STRSIZE chars (default 32)
  -t             print absolute timestamp
  -tt            print absolute timestamp with usecs
  -T             print time spent in each syscall
  -x             print non-ascii strings in hex
  -xx            print all strings in hex
  -y             print paths associated with file descriptor arguments
  -yy            print protocol specific information associated with socket file descriptors

Statistics:
  -c             count time, calls, and errors for each syscall and report summary
  -C             like -c but also print regular output
  -O overhead    set overhead for tracing syscalls to OVERHEAD usecs
  -S sortby      sort syscall counts by: time, calls, name, nothing (default time)
  -w             summarise syscall latency (default is system time)

Filtering:
  -e expr        a qualifying expression: option=[!]all or option=[!]val1[,val2]...
     options:    trace, abbrev, verbose, raw, signal, read, write, fault
  -P path        trace accesses to path

Tracing:
  -b execve      detach on execve syscall
  -D             run tracer process as a detached grandchild, not as parent
  -f             follow forks
  -ff            follow forks with output into separate files
  -I interruptible
     1:          no signals are blocked
     2:          fatal signals are blocked while decoding syscall (default)
     3:          fatal signals are always blocked (default if '-o FILE PROG')
     4:          fatal signals and SIGTSTP (^Z) are always blocked
                 (useful to make 'strace -o FILE PROG' not stop on ^Z)

Startup:
  -E var         remove var from the environment for command
  -E var=val     put var=val in the environment for command
  -p pid         trace process with process id PID, may be repeated
  -u username    run command as username handling setuid and/or setgid

Miscellaneous:
  -d             enable debug output to stderr
  -v             verbose mode: print unabbreviated argv, stat, termios, etc. args
  -h             print help message
  -V             print version

Try 'stat --help' for more information.
pi@screenlypi3:~ $ stat --help
Usage: stat [OPTION]... FILE...
Display file or file system status.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -L, --dereference     follow links
  -f, --file-system     display file system status instead of file status
  -c  --format=FORMAT   use the specified FORMAT instead of the default;
                          output a newline after each use of FORMAT
      --printf=FORMAT   like --format, but interpret backslash escapes,
                          and do not output a mandatory trailing newline;
                          if you want a newline, include \n in FORMAT
  -t, --terse           print the information in terse form
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

The valid format sequences for files (without --file-system):

  %a   access rights in octal (note '#' and '0' printf flags)
  %A   access rights in human readable form
  %b   number of blocks allocated (see %B)
  %B   the size in bytes of each block reported by %b
  %C   SELinux security context string
  %d   device number in decimal
  %D   device number in hex
  %f   raw mode in hex
  %F   file type
  %g   group ID of owner
  %G   group name of owner
  %h   number of hard links
  %i   inode number
  %m   mount point
  %n   file name
  %N   quoted file name with dereference if symbolic link
  %o   optimal I/O transfer size hint
  %s   total size, in bytes
  %t   major device type in hex, for character/block device special files
  %T   minor device type in hex, for character/block device special files
  %u   user ID of owner
  %U   user name of owner
  %w   time of file birth, human-readable; - if unknown
  %W   time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
  %x   time of last access, human-readable
  %X   time of last access, seconds since Epoch
  %y   time of last data modification, human-readable
  %Y   time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
  %z   time of last status change, human-readable
  %Z   time of last status change, seconds since Epoch

Valid format sequences for file systems:

  %a   free blocks available to non-superuser
  %b   total data blocks in file system
  %c   total file nodes in file system
  %d   free file nodes in file system
  %f   free blocks in file system
  %i   file system ID in hex
  %l   maximum length of filenames
  %n   file name
  %s   block size (for faster transfers)
  %S   fundamental block size (for block counts)
  %t   file system type in hex
  %T   file system type in human readable form

NOTE: your shell may have its own version of stat, which usually supersedes
the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation
for details about the options it supports.

    Modify shell resource limits.
    
    Provides control over the resources available to the shell and processes
    it creates, on systems that allow such control.
    
    Options:
      -S	use the `soft' resource limit
      -H	use the `hard' resource limit
      -a	all current limits are reported
      -b	the socket buffer size
      -c	the maximum size of core files created
      -d	the maximum size of a process's data segment
      -e	the maximum scheduling priority (`nice')
      -f	the maximum size of files written by the shell and its children
      -i	the maximum number of pending signals
      -k	the maximum number of kqueues allocated for this process
      -l	the maximum size a process may lock into memory
      -m	the maximum resident set size
      -n	the maximum number of open file descriptors
      -p	the pipe buffer size
      -q	the maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues
      -r	the maximum real-time scheduling priority
      -s	the maximum stack size
      -t	the maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
      -u	the maximum number of user processes
      -v	the size of virtual memory
      -x	the maximum number of file locks
      -P	the maximum number of pseudoterminals
      -T	the maximum number of threads
    
    Not all options are available on all platforms.
    
    If LIMIT is given, it is the new value of the specified resource; the
    special LIMIT values `soft', `hard', and `unlimited' stand for the
    current soft limit, the current hard limit, and no limit, respectively.
    Otherwise, the current value of the specified resource is printed.  If
    no option is given, then -f is assumed.
    
    Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for -t, which is in seconds,
    -p, which is in increments of 512 bytes, and -u, which is an unscaled
    number of processes.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or an error occurs.
